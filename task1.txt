Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/2 achieves faster webpage loading without performance optimizations that require extensive human efforts in terms of development.
It significantly reduces the complexities that had crept into HTTP/1.1 and gives us a robust protocol which, though not without its flaws, will perhaps stand the test of time.
Before making this leap forward, let’s trace our steps back to when the internet was in its infancy to understand how the different versions evolved into the current form.
HTTP1 usest works on the textual format.
HTTP2 works on the binary protocol.
In HTTP1 there is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
In HTTP2 allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
HTTP1 uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
HTTP2 uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
HTTP1 compresses data by itself.
HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
